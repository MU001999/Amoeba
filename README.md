In fact, I am trying to rewrite this program now. If you want to use this language to do something, you can visit [this](https://github.com/ice-lang/ice-old-version), a old version with the implementation of interpretor.

## ToDo-List

Ice-lang is segrageted to about three parts, the front end, codegen and the virtual machine. I am planning to implement the front end firstly, then virtual machine and the codegen part finally.

+ [X] Implementation of the front end
+ [ ] Add more tests for the front end
+ [ ] Design the opcode and how the vm works
